        <p>
          We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind.
          That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before
          outright replacing it, wherever possible – it requires fewer materials
          and is easier on the planet, as well as your wallet! If another
          company tells you that your system needs to be replaced, just give us
          a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

          <h6>Customer Care</h6>
          <p>
            As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come
            cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone, so we
            price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more affordable.
            We're focused on helping you and on helping the environment, rather
            than on turning a profit.

          <p>
            As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the planet and
            about seeing people embrace a greener, more eco-friendly approach to
            power. The world of green energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so
            we want to help educate people on the big and little things they can
            do to protect our planet!
